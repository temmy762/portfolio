# Styling Issues Fixed

## Problems Resolved

1. **Tailwind CSS Version Conflicts**
   - Removed `@tailwindcss/postcss` v4.1.7 which was incompatible with the main Tailwind CSS v3.4.1
   - Updated PostCSS configuration to use the standard `tailwindcss` plugin name

2. **PostCSS Configuration**
   - Fixed the PostCSS configuration in both `postcss.config.js` and `postcss.config.mjs`
   - Changed from `@tailwindcss/postcss` to `tailwindcss` for better compatibility

3. **VS Code Settings**
   - Added proper CSS validation settings to recognize Tailwind directives
   - Configured IntelliSense support for TypeScript and React files
   - Added experimental class regex for additional class utilities

4. **Documentation**
   - Updated CSS_CONFIGURATION.md with the correct information about Tailwind setup
   - Fixed incorrect information about Tailwind CSS plugin packaging

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Image Path Issues**
   - There might still be 404 errors for testimonial images that need to be addressed

2. **React Warnings**
   - Some empty string src attributes in images might generate warnings
   - Preload warnings about empty href values should be checked

## Testing Steps

1. **Visual Inspection**
   - Verify that all styling is correctly applied to the website
   - Check responsive design on different screen sizes

2. **Browser Console**
   - Check for any remaining 404 errors or warnings in the browser console

3. **Build Process**
   - Test a production build to ensure styles are properly included:
     ```
     npm run build
     ```

## Summary

The main issue was a conflict between Tailwind CSS versions. The project was using Tailwind CSS v3.4.1 as the main dependency but also had `@tailwindcss/postcss` v4.1.7 configured in the PostCSS setup. By standardizing on v3.4.1 and using the correct plugin name in the PostCSS configuration, the styling issues have been resolved.
